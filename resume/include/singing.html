<p>This was a event page of singing competition. It wasn't online because of the company decided to reject the event. The competition was main to cover the amazing song "Say Hi to the World" form <a href="https://www.facebook.com/transitiontw" target="_blank">Transition 前進樂團</a>, who was the endorsement of Hitutor. We needed creative covers, therefore I used energetic design to perform the visuals.</p>
