<h3 class="mt-1">Calendar</h3>

<p>Including tour and hotel booking, I designed two style for the order calendar. One is main for available date, and the other for price. According to the hotel booking rules, if customers book weekend or holiday, they need to pay an additional charge. Cost on calendar is much easier to notice that.</p>

<p class="mt-1">Furthermore, there has many type of tour's available date. Such as weekend, work day or the first friday of the month. All of those dates aren't stored in database due to limit of the EIP System. Therefore I created a json file to manage that.</p>

<h3 class="mt-1">Previous Version of Calendar</h3>

<p>This is the calendar I made one years ago. With more text information and large click area, I think it is still useful in some project.</p>
