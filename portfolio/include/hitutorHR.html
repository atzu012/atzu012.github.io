<p>This was a website of hiring online language teacher. I advised HR that we could put some information form important pages. When user went to our website, they could get the information whitout clicked specific links. The form of application was a huge list needed to input. Therefore I designed all of jobs to use the same form in the same page. Teachers could input their name one time to apply America English and British English.</p>

<p class="mt-1">Now, the online website's apply form is linked to google web form in browse job page. 😭</p>
