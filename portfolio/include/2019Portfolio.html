<p>The <a href="https://atzu012.github.io/gallery/" target="_blank">Portfolio</a> in 2019. I collected some of the period products to bulid my portfolio. It has three parts, whitch are Website & EDM, Banner and Platform. The online learning language campony needed a lot of advertisements to attract people to join our courses. Included English course, Japanese course, business course for camponys and collaboration events. The landing pages usually ordered with banners but couldn't let all banners fallowed the key vision. So I focused on letter's typesettings and animations.</p>

<p class="mt-1">The campony also had it's own platforms. Like interface for students, teachers or consultants to manage their courses, teaching materials or customer services. The platforms was more complicated than landing pages and websites. My work was turned UI designer's PSD file to HTML and found js plugins for projects.</p>
