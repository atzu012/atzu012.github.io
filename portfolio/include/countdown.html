<p>This is a vue-countdown project. I was wondering a simple way to give a countdown for my brother who hasn't nay knowhow of web. It setted until time by url. For example, added <strong>?date=20221231</strong> behide the url, the countdown will start from today until 2022/12/31. So that I could just give him a link without setting every time.</p>
