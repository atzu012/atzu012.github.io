<p>This is a redesign project. HanhSiu is a buddhism organization that want to build a website to store their recording of buddhist scriptures. Old version website was builded by university students of Information Management. That worked fine but not friendly for users. So I changed the interface to e-book's style and made index page more beautiful and elegant, in order to attract user's will to spend more time to understand HanhSiu.</p>

<h3 class="mt-1">Index Page</h3>

<p>Index is most important page that let user to know what is this website. So I added more information about hanhsiu in there. Also simplified top navbar's item. That made surface more clean and useful.</p>

<p>Chinese has a lot of letters cause considerable file size of web font. That made website to need additional time in loading. So I picked up the letters must be showed in particular font style, that helped me decrease 99% size.</p>
